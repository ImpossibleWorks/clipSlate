## Overview

**clipSlate** – your ultimate solution to the age-old challenge in video production playback!

If you're in video production and you playback videos, you've probably loaded a video and found yourself starting a black screen (the first frame of a video that fades in from black). **clipSlate** steps in to revolutionize your workflow, ensuring that the first frame hiccup is a thing of the past.

Here's how it works: **clipSlate** captures multiple stills from different points throughout the entire video and creates a slate on the very first frame of the video, along with the filename and the TRT.

When you load your video into your playback system, gone are the days of uncertainty. **clipSlate** provides instant clarity, allowing you to see a comprehensive snapshot of your video content right from the get-go. No more guessing games or anxious moments – you'll know exactly what you're about to play.

As the composite frame is only on the very first frame of the video, you'll see what's going on before you play the video, but the viewers will seamlessly transition into the heart of the video without ever encountering the initial screen. Say goodbye to being unsure if this is the right video and hello to confident playback.

With **clipSlate**, every first frame tells the whole story. Streamline your production workflow, eliminate uncertainty, and ensure your videos take center stage from the very beginning.

## Using clipSlate

Currently, this is python script (with plans to make a standalone executable in the near future).

## Things to do

Here is a punchlist things to look into:

- [ ] Add-in ability to point clipSlate to a directory, intead of just a single file.
- [ ] Compile into standalone executable, for Mac + Win.
- [ ] Optimize the ffmpeg encoding.
